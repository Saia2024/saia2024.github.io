                        <h3>Inception and Early Days</h3>
                        <p>The roots of naval diving in Sri Lanka, then Ceylon, trace back to the era of the Royal Ceylon Navy (RCyN). The primary role was rudimentary, focusing on ship's bottom maintenance, propeller clearing, and minor underwater repairs. Divers were trained on a small scale, often by foreign naval missions, using basic equipment like the Standard Diving Dress (hard-hat diving). The capability was essential but not established as a specialized, distinct branch.</p>

                        <h3>Establishment of the Diving Unit</h3>
                        <p>Recognizing the need for a specialized and self-sufficient underwater operations capability, the Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) officially established its Diving Unit in the early 1980s. This marked a significant turning point. A dedicated training curriculum was developed, and personnel were selected for their exceptional physical fitness, mental resilience, and aptitude for underwater work. The initial focus was on Clearance Diving (CD) tasks, including underwater search, salvage, and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD).</p>

                        <h3>Growth and Specialization</h3>
                        <p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Diving Unit underwent significant expansion and modernization. Advanced training was sought from friendly foreign navies, including those of India, Pakistan, the United States, and the United Kingdom. This exposure brought in new techniques and technologies. The unit diversified its skill set to include deep diving, underwater cutting and welding, demolition, and maritime salvage operations. The acquisition of modern scuba gear, re-breathers, and specialized EOD equipment enhanced their operational effectiveness.</p>

                        <h3>Contributions During the Conflict</h3>
                        <p>The role of the Navy Diving Unit was indispensable during Sri Lanka's internal conflict. Divers were at the forefront of maritime security operations, conducting critical tasks such as: Harbour Security, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), and Salvage and Recovery.</p>
                        <p>They conducted underwater searches of ship hulls to prevent limpet mine attacks in naval harbours, neutralized underwater-laid improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and played a pivotal role in salvaging naval assets and recovering sensitive equipment from sunken vessels, often in high-risk environments.</p>

                        <h3>Post-Conflict Era and Modernization</h3>
                        <p>With the end of the conflict in 2009, the Diving and Salvage Unit transitioned its focus towards nation-building and enhancing its role as a key maritime asset. The unit has been instrumental in numerous civilian and national projects, including underwater construction support, salvaging civilian shipwrecks, conducting hydrographic surveys, and participating in disaster relief operations during floods and maritime accidents. Continuous modernization efforts ensure the unit remains equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including side-scan sonars, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and advanced decompression chambers.</p>

                        <p>Today, the Sri Lanka Navy Diving and Salvage Unit stands as a highly professional and respected force. Its vision is to be the premier underwater operations unit in the region, capable of undertaking a full spectrum of diving and salvage missions. The focus remains on rigorous training, technological advancement, and upholding the highest standards of safety and professionalism, ensuring they remain the "Guardians of the Deep" for the nation.</p>
